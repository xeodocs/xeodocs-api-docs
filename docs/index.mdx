## Overview

XeoDocs is a backend system designed for AI-driven translations of open-source technology documentation, typically from English to other languages. Built as a Golang monorepo with microservices, it integrates tools like PostgreSQL, MinIO, and AI APIs to manage, translate, and build multilingual documentation sites.
