XeoDocs is an innovative platform designed to bridge language barriers in the open-source software community. At its core, XeoDocs leverages artificial intelligence to provide accurate, up-to-date translations of technology documentation, typically from English into multiple other languages. Hosted on xeodocs.com, it empowers developers worldwide to access high-quality docs in their preferred language, fostering global collaboration and innovation.

## Motivation

The open-source ecosystem thrives on accessible knowledge, but language limitations often hinder participation. XeoDocs addresses this by:

- Delivering **real-time translations** that stay synchronized with the original English content.
- Generating web traffic through subtle, non-intrusive banners that highlight related projects, helping creators promote their work.

By automating translations, XeoDocs ensures that documentation remains current without manual effort, benefiting both contributors and users.

## How It Works

XeoDocs operates as a seamless system for managing and translating open-source repos:

1. **Add a Project**: Submit project details including repository URLs, target languages, build commands, and auto-flags via API or the admin panel.
2. **Repository Management**: The system forks the source repository, performs a shallow clone to local storage, creates branches for each target language within the cloned repository, and detects translatable files (e.g., Markdown, HTML).
3. **AI-Powered Translation**: Using advanced AI models, content on language branches is translated while preserving technical accuracy, code blocks, and formatting.
4. **Periodic Updates**: Automatically pulls changes from the source repo, detects modifications via hashes, re-translates affected content if enabled, and optionally builds and publishes updates.
5. **Static Generation**: Builds and exports the translated branches into static files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.) with injected banners for efficient hosting on platforms like Vercel or Cloudflare.
6. **Deployment**: The final static sites are pushed to dedicated Git repositories per language, ready for publication to drive engagement.

This process ensures cost-effective, scalable deployment while keeping translations fresh.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Language Support**: Translate into languages like Spanish, French, German, and more.
- **Open-Source Friendly**: Works with any public Git repo, respecting licenses.
- **Admin Panel**: A user-friendly Next.js interface for managing projects, monitoring translations, and viewing logs.
- **Secure and Scalable**: Backend built in Golang with microservices, JWT authentication, and Docker deployment.

## Benefits

- **For Developers**: Access docs in your native language, speeding up learning and contribution.
- **For Project Owners**: Expand your audience globally with minimal effort.
- **For the Community**: Promotes inclusivity in tech, with AI ensuring high-fidelity translations.
