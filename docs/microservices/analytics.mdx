description: Overview of the Analytics Service microservice in XeoDocs' architecture, providing APIs for querying traffic analytics data.

The Analytics Service is a query-focused component of XeoDocs. Built in Golang, this microservice queries aggregated traffic data from InfluxDB and exposes REST APIs for retrieving statistics, enabling frontend visualization of site performance.

## Role in XeoDocs

In XeoDocs' microservices setup, the Analytics Service acts as the data retrieval layer for insights:

- **Data Querying**: Fetches aggregated metrics from InfluxDB for views, sessions, and referrers.
- **API Exposure**: Provides endpoints for the frontend to request stats, supporting dashboards and reports.
- **Performance Optimization**: Separates querying from processing to ensure fast responses for analytics data.

This enables users to monitor the impact of translated documentation on traffic.

## How It Works

1. **Request Handling**: Receives API requests from the frontend via the API Gateway.
2. **InfluxDB Queries**: Constructs and executes queries on InfluxDB for time-series data, filtering by project, language, and date ranges.
3. **Data Formatting**: Aggregates and formats results into JSON responses for charts (e.g., using Chart.js).
4. **Caching**: Optionally caches frequent queries to improve performance.

All endpoints are prefixed with `/v1/analytics` and documented in the OpenAPI spec.

## Key Features

- **InfluxDB Client**: Uses the InfluxDB Go client for querying time-series data efficiently.
- **Flexible Queries**: Supports filters like date ranges, project slugs, and languages for targeted analytics.
- **JSON Responses**: Returns structured data for easy integration with frontend libraries.
- **Rate Limiting**: Integrates with gateway middleware to prevent abuse.
- **Logging**: Records query metrics via the Logging Service.

## Analytics Service Endpoints

Below is a list of its endpoints with short descriptions:

### Analytics Endpoints
- **GET /v1/analytics/\{projectSlug\}**: Retrieve traffic stats for a project (e.g., views, unique users) with optional query params like `lang`, `dateRange`.
- **GET /v1/analytics/\{projectSlug\}/pages**: Get page-level metrics (e.g., top pages by views).
- **GET /v1/analytics/\{projectSlug\}/referrers**: List referrer sources and counts.

These endpoints provide comprehensive traffic insights, supporting XeoDocs' analytics workflows.

## Deployment

- **Docker**: Built with `Dockerfile.analytics`; runs in `docker-compose.dev.yml`.

The Analytics Service delivers actionable data for optimizing translated content in XeoDocs.
