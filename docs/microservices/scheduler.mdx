The Scheduler Service is a key background component in XeoDocs. Developed in Golang, this service orchestrates periodic tasks such as Git repository updates, automatic re-translations, and builds, ensuring that translated content remains synchronized with the original sources without manual intervention.

## Role in XeoDocs

In XeoDocs' microservices architecture, the Scheduler Service handles automated maintenance:

- **Periodic Operations**: Runs cron-like jobs to pull changes from source repositories, detect modifications, and trigger downstream processes like translations and static generations.
- **System Efficiency**: Keeps the platform proactive by automating updates, reducing latency in delivering fresh translations.
- **Integration**: Interacts with other services (e.g., Project for git pulls, Translation for re-translations, Build for regenerations) via internal API calls, logging activities to the Logging Service.

This service operates silently in the background, enhancing the reliability of AI-powered translation workflows.

## How It Works

1. **Job Scheduling**: Uses the `gocron` library to define and run tasks at intervals (e.g., hourly git pulls for all projects).
2. **Change Detection**: For each project, performs `git pull` on the original repo, checks for differences using file hashes, and propagates updates to language-specific copies.
3. **Trigger Actions**: If changes are detected in translatable files, invokes the Translation Service; follows up with the Build Service if necessary.
4. **Logging**: Records cron run outcomes (success, errors) to the Logging Service for monitoring.

## Key Features

- **Configurable Intervals**: Jobs can be scheduled via environment variables (e.g., every hour, day) for flexibility.
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Uses goroutines for parallel processing of multiple projects.
- **Error Handling**: Retries failed operations (e.g., git pulls) with exponential backoff.
- **No Public API**: Internal-only, focused on automation rather than user-facing endpoints.

## Scheduler Service Endpoints

Scheduler Service handles background scheduling for tasks like periodic git pulls and auto-translations. It has no public endpoints, as it runs internal cron jobs without exposing any user-facing APIs.

## Deployment

- **Docker**: Built with `Dockerfile.scheduler`; runs without exposing ports (internal) in `docker-compose.dev.yml`.

The Scheduler Service keeps XeoDocs dynamic, automating AI translations and updates for open-source docs.
