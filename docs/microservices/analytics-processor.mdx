description: Overview of the Analytics Processor microservice in XeoDocs' architecture, handling event processing and aggregation for traffic analytics.

The Analytics Processor Service is a dedicated component of XeoDocs. Built in Golang, this microservice consumes raw traffic events from Kafka, processes and aggregates them, and stores the results in InfluxDB for efficient time-series analytics.

## Role in XeoDocs

In XeoDocs' microservices setup, the Analytics Processor Service acts as the data pipeline for traffic insights:

- **Event Consumption**: Reads raw events from Kafka topics like "raw_traffic_events" to handle high-volume traffic data asynchronously.
- **Data Processing**: Performs deduplication, session aggregation, and counting of page views, referrers, and other metrics.
- **Storage**: Writes aggregated data to InfluxDB for optimized querying and visualization.

This separation ensures scalable analytics without impacting core translation workflows.

## How It Works

1. **Kafka Consumption**: The service runs as a Kafka consumer, subscribing to topics for incoming events from tracking snippets.
2. **Event Processing**: Parses events, handles duplicates, and aggregates metrics (e.g., unique users, sessions) in memory or batches.
3. **InfluxDB Storage**: Writes processed data points to InfluxDB with timestamps for historical analysis.
4. **Error Handling**: Logs failures and retries, ensuring data integrity for traffic reporting.

All processing is internal, with no public endpoints.

## Key Features

- **Kafka Integration**: Uses `confluent-kafka-go` or `sarama` for reliable event streaming and consumer groups.
- **Aggregation Logic**: Implements session tracking, view counting, and deduplication to reduce noise in analytics.
- **InfluxDB Client**: Connects to InfluxDB for writing time-series data efficiently.
- **Concurrency**: Goroutines for parallel processing of events to handle spikes in traffic.
- **Logging**: Integrates with the Logging Service for monitoring processing status.

## Analytics Processor Service Endpoints

This service has no public endpoints; it operates internally via Kafka consumption and InfluxDB writes.

## Deployment

- **Docker**: Built with `Dockerfile.analytics-processor`; runs in `docker-compose.dev.yml`.

The Analytics Processor Service enables valuable traffic insights for XeoDocs, supporting data-driven decisions on translated content.
