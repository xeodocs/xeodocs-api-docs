description: Overview of the Build microservice in XeoDocs' architecture, responsible for generating static translated documentation sites with AI-powered content.

The Build Service is an essential microservice in XeoDocs. Developed in Golang, this service handles the compilation, static export, and deployment preparation of translated content, ensuring efficient delivery of multilingual docs.

## Role in XeoDocs

Within XeoDocs' microservices ecosystem, the Build Service focuses on transforming translated repositories into deployable static websites:

- **Static Generation**: Converts dynamic previews into static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images) for cost-effective hosting.
- **Banner Injection**: Adds non-intrusive promotional banners to drive traffic to related projects.
- **Integration**: Works post-translation, triggered by Worker Service to finalize content and upload to target repositories.

This service supports XeoDocs' goal of providing up-to-date, accessible translations by automating the build and deployment pipeline.

## How It Works

1. **Trigger Build**: Called internally by Worker Service for a project (optionally specific language), operates on mounted volume directories.
2. **Execute Commands**: Runs framework-specific commands (e.g., `npm run build`) using `os/exec`.
3. **Export or Scrape**: If export command exists, uses it; otherwise, starts preview server and scrapes with Colly.
4. **Banner Injection**: Post-processes HTML to insert banners.
5. **Deployment**: Pushes static files to target Git repository for hosting.

This ensures translated content is built and deployed automatically.

## Key Features

- **Framework Agnostic**: Supports common doc frameworks (e.g., Next.js, Docusaurus) via configurable build/export commands.
- **Fallback Scraping**: Uses `gocolly/colly` for dynamic sites without native static export.
- **Git Deployment**: Pushes built static files to target repositories for hosting.
- **Mounted Volumes**: Operates on shared mounted volumes for file access.
- **Error Resilience**: Includes retries for command execution and logging to the Logging Service.

## Build Service Endpoints

Build Service provides private APIs for build and deployment operations, invoked by the Worker Service. Below is a list of its endpoints:

### Build Endpoints
- **POST /internal/build-task**: Execute the build process and static generation for a project's translated content, optionally for a specific language.

These endpoints are private and secured for service-to-service communication.

## Deployment

- **Docker**: Uses `Dockerfile.build` with Node.js; exposes port 8084 in `docker-compose.dev.yml`.
- **Volumes**: Mounts shared volume for accessing repository files.

The Build Service completes the XeoDocs pipeline, turning AI-translated content into ready-to-deploy sites.
