The Project Service is a foundational microservice in XeoDocs. Written in Golang, this service manages the creation, updating, and deletion of projects, including cloning Git repositories, detecting translatable content, and preparing language-specific copies for translation.

## Role in XeoDocs

In XeoDocs' microservices framework, the Project Service serves as the entry point for onboarding new documentation projects:

- **Project Management**: Provides CRUD operations for projects, storing details like repo URLs, languages, and build commands.
- **Repository Handling**: Clones or forks public Git repos, identifies files for translation (e.g., Markdown, HTML), and creates per-language copies.
- **Integration**: Collaborates with the Translation and Build Services to enable AI translations and static generation, ensuring seamless workflows.

This service lays the groundwork for keeping translations synchronized with original English content.

## How It Works

1. **Create Project**: Via `/v1/projects` POST, users add a project with details like doc URL, repo URL, languages (e.g., 'es', 'fr'), and commands.
2. **Clone and Detect**: Uses go-git to clone the repo to a local directory (e.g., `/repos/{id}/original`), then scans for translatable files using filepath.Walk.
3. **Language Copies**: Duplicates the repo for each language (e.g., `/repos/{id}/es`), logging paths to the tracked_files table in PostgreSQL.
4. **Update and Delete**: Handles modifications (e.g., adding languages) and cleanup, ensuring data consistency across services.

## Key Features

- **Git Integration**: Leverages `go-git` for cloning, pulling, and change detection to keep content up-to-date.
- **File Tracking**: Automatically detects and logs translatable files, with hashes for efficient update detection.
- **Scalable Storage**: Uses MinIO or local filesystem for repo copies, supporting large documentation sets.
- **CRUD Endpoints**: Fully RESTful with pagination and filtering for listing projects.

## Project Service Endpoints

Project Service manages the CRUD operations for projects, including repository setup and language configurations. Below is a list of its endpoints with short descriptions:

### Project Management Endpoints
- **POST /v1/projects**: Create a new project, specifying details like documentation URL, repository URL, languages, and build commands.
- **GET /v1/projects**: List all projects (paginated), with optional filters for pagination.
- **GET /v1/projects/\{id\}**: Retrieve details of a specific project by ID.
- **PUT /v1/projects/\{id\}**: Update an existing project's details, such as adding languages or modifying commands.
- **DELETE /v1/projects/\{id\}**: Delete a project and its associated repository copies.

These endpoints support XeoDocs' workflows for onboarding open-source docs for AI translations, with all requests protected by JWT via the API Gateway.

## Deployment

- **Docker**: Built via `Dockerfile.project`; exposes port 8082 in `docker-compose.dev.yml`.

The Project Service enables efficient management of open-source docs, paving the way for AI translations and static deployments in XeoDocs.
