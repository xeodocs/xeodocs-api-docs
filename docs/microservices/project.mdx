description: Overview of the Project microservice in XeoDocs' architecture, handling repository management and setup for AI-powered translations of open-source documentation.

The Project Service is a foundational microservice in XeoDocs. Written in Golang, this service manages the creation, updating, and deletion of projects, including coordinating repository setup, detecting translatable content, and preparing language-specific copies for translation.

## Role in XeoDocs

In XeoDocs' microservices framework, the Project Service serves as the entry point for onboarding new documentation projects:

- **Project Management**: Provides CRUD operations for projects, storing details like repo URLs, languages, and build commands.
- **Task Enqueuing**: Upon project creation, enqueues "clone_repo" tasks to RabbitMQ, returns 202 Accepted immediately.
- **Integration**: Collaborates with Worker Service for asynchronous repository setup and file detection.

This service lays the groundwork for keeping translations synchronized with original English content.

## How It Works

1. **Create Project**: Via public `/v1/projects` POST, stores project details, enqueues "clone_repo" task to RabbitMQ, returns 202 Accepted.
2. **Async Setup**: Worker Service processes task, calls Repository Service for cloning and file detection, creates language copies.
3. **Update and Delete**: Handles modifications and cleanup synchronously.

This ensures immediate response while processing occurs in the background.

## Key Features

- **Async Task Handling**: Enqueues setup tasks to RabbitMQ for immediate 202 responses.
- **File Tracking**: Logs translatable files with hashes for update detection.
- **Local Storage**: Integrates with mounted volumes for repository handling.
- **CRUD Endpoints**: RESTful with pagination for project management.

## Project Service Endpoints

Project Service manages the CRUD operations for projects, including repository setup and language configurations. Below is a list of its endpoints with short descriptions:

### Project Management Endpoints
- **POST /v1/projects**: Create a new project, specifying details like documentation URL, repository URL, languages, and build commands.
- **GET /v1/projects**: List all projects (paginated), with optional filters for pagination.
- **GET /v1/projects/\{id\}**: Retrieve details of a specific project by ID.
- **PUT /v1/projects/\{id\}**: Update an existing project's details, such as adding languages or modifying commands.
- **DELETE /v1/projects/\{id\}**: Delete a project and its associated repository copies.

These endpoints support XeoDocs' workflows for onboarding open-source docs for AI translations, with all requests protected by JWT via the API Gateway.

## Deployment

- **Docker**: Built via `Dockerfile.project`; exposes port 8082 in `docker-compose.dev.yml`.

The Project Service enables efficient management of open-source docs, paving the way for AI translations and static deployments in XeoDocs.
