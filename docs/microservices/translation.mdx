The Translation Service is a critical microservice in XeoDocs. Built in Golang, this service utilizes AI models to translate tracked files accurately, maintaining technical integrity, code blocks, and formatting for seamless multilingual access.

## Role in XeoDocs

In XeoDocs' microservices architecture, the Translation Service focuses on the core AI translation process:

- **AI Translation Execution**: Processes translatable content from project repositories, leveraging APIs like xAI or OpenAI for high-quality results.
- **Status Monitoring**: Provides real-time updates on translation progress for each language.
- **Integration**: Works in tandem with the Project Service (for file access) and Build Service (for post-translation static generation), ensuring end-to-end automation.

This service enables XeoDocs to deliver up-to-date, AI-powered translations, bridging language gaps in the open-source community.

## How It Works

1. **Trigger Translation**: Initiated via `/v1/projects/{id}/translate` (for all or specific languages), it reads tracked files from language-specific repo copies.
2. **Content Chunking**: Breaks large files into manageable chunks (e.g., under 4k tokens) to optimize AI API calls.
3. **AI Prompting**: Sends prompts like "Translate this technical documentation from English to \{lang\}, preserving markdown and code blocks" to the AI API.
4. **Parallel Processing**: Uses goroutines and sync.WaitGroup to translate files concurrently across languages.
5. **Update and Save**: Writes translated content back, updates metadata (e.g., last_translated_at, hash), and logs progress.

## Key Features

- **AI Model Integration**: Supports xAI/OpenAI for contextual, accurate translations tailored to technical docs.
- **Preservation of Structure**: Ensures code, markdown, and formatting remain intact during translation.
- **Async Status Checks**: Endpoint `/v1/projects/{id}/status` for polling progress (e.g., "completed", "in progress").
- **Error Handling**: Retries failed API calls and logs issues to the Logging Service.

## Translation Service Endpoints

Translation Service handles AI-driven translation triggers and status monitoring. Below is a list of its endpoints with short descriptions:

### Translation Endpoints
- **POST /v1/projects/\{id\}/translate**: Trigger AI translation for a project's tracked files, optionally for a specific language.
- **GET /v1/projects/\{id\}/status**: Retrieve the status of ongoing or completed AI translations (and related builds) for a project, with details per language.

These endpoints support XeoDocs' workflows for accurate, AI-based translations, with all requests protected by JWT via the API Gateway.

## Deployment

- **Docker**: Built with `Dockerfile.translation`; exposes port 8083 in `docker-compose.dev.yml`.

The Translation Service powers the AI core of XeoDocs, enabling efficient conversions of English documentation into other languages.
