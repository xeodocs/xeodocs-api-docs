The Translation Service is a critical microservice in XeoDocs. Built in Golang, this service utilizes AI models to translate tracked files accurately, maintaining technical integrity, code blocks, and formatting for seamless multilingual access.

## Role in XeoDocs

In XeoDocs' microservices architecture, the Translation Service focuses on the core AI translation process:

- **Task Enqueuing**: Receives translation requests, enqueues "translate_files" tasks to RabbitMQ, returns 202 Accepted immediately.
- **Async Processing**: Tasks are processed asynchronously by the Worker Service using AI models.
- **Integration**: Collaborates with Worker for file access and processing, ensuring end-to-end automation.

This service enables XeoDocs to deliver up-to-date, AI-powered translations, bridging language gaps in the open-source community.

## How It Works

1. **Trigger Translation**: Receives request via public endpoint, enqueues "translate_files" task to RabbitMQ, returns 202 Accepted.
2. **Async Processing**: Worker Service consumes task, chunks content, prompts AI, writes back, updates metadata.
3. **Status Monitoring**: Provides polling endpoint for progress.

This decouples request from execution, enhancing responsiveness.

## Key Features

- **AI Model Integration**: Supports xAI/OpenAI for contextual, accurate translations tailored to technical docs.
- **Task Enqueuing**: Enqueues translation tasks asynchronously via RabbitMQ for immediate response.
- **Async Processing**: Worker handles chunking, prompting, and saving with goroutines.
- **Status Monitoring**: Polling endpoint for tracking progress.
- **Error Handling**: Retries failed API calls and logs issues to the Logging Service.

## Translation Service Endpoints

Translation Service handles AI-driven translation triggers and status monitoring. Below is a list of its endpoints with short descriptions:

### Translation Endpoints
- **POST /v1/projects/\{id\}/translate**: Trigger AI translation for a project's tracked files, optionally for a specific language.
- **GET /v1/projects/\{id\}/status**: Retrieve the status of ongoing or completed AI translations (and related builds) for a project, with details per language.

These endpoints support XeoDocs' workflows for accurate, AI-based translations, with all requests protected by JWT via the API Gateway.

## Deployment

- **Docker**: Built with `Dockerfile.translation`; exposes port 8083 in `docker-compose.dev.yml`.

The Translation Service powers the AI core of XeoDocs, enabling efficient conversions of English documentation into other languages.
