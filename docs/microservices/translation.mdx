The Translation Service is a critical microservice in XeoDocs. Built in Golang, this service utilizes AI models to translate tracked files accurately, maintaining technical integrity, code blocks, and formatting for seamless multilingual access.

## Role in XeoDocs

In XeoDocs' microservices architecture, the Translation Service focuses on the core AI translation process:

- **Internal Triggering**: Called by Worker Service after repository setup or change detection to start AI processing on translatable files.
- **Async Processing**: Processes translation tasks asynchronously using AI models for file chunks.
- **Integration**: Collaborates with Worker for file access and processing, ensuring end-to-end automation.

This service enables XeoDocs to deliver up-to-date, AI-powered translations, bridging language gaps in the open-source community.

## How It Works

1. **Internal Trigger**: Called by Worker Service via POST `/internal/translate-task` after repository setup or change detection.
2. **Async Processing**: Chunks translatable content, prompts AI models, translates, and writes back to language branches.
3. **Status Monitoring**: Updates project status in database for polling.

This decouples triggering from execution, enhancing responsiveness.

## Key Features

- **AI Model Integration**: Supports xAI/OpenAI for contextual, accurate translations tailored to technical docs.
- **Internal Processing**: Handles translation tasks triggered by Worker Service for file chunks.
- **Async Processing**: Processes translations asynchronously with goroutines for efficiency.
- **Status Monitoring**: Updates database with translation progress for polling.
- **Error Handling**: Retries failed API calls and logs issues to the Logging Service.

## Translation Service Endpoints

Translation Service handles AI-driven translation triggers and status monitoring. Below is a list of its endpoints with short descriptions:

### Translation Endpoints
- **POST /internal/translate-task**: Trigger AI translation processing on translatable files within language branches (called internally by Worker Service).
- **GET /v1/projects/\{id\}/status**: Retrieve the status of ongoing or completed AI translations (and related builds) for a project, with details per language.

These endpoints support XeoDocs' workflows for accurate, AI-based translations, with all requests protected by JWT via the API Gateway.

## Deployment

- **Docker**: Built with `Dockerfile.translation`; runs in `docker-compose.dev.yml`.

The Translation Service powers the AI core of XeoDocs, enabling efficient conversions of English documentation into other languages.
